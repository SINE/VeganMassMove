## VeganMassMove

This is a fork of the LUA-Script based Plug-In by FH3095 for Teamspeak3.
This Plug-In allows a user to move users of a channel to the target channel.


#### Features
- German Language (may be extended in the future)
- No "Move whole server" Button (which can lead to a lot of trouble sometimes)
- Move Users from selected channel to your channel
- Move Users from your channel to selected channel
- New Icons
- Channel Password compatibility (thanks to Dave from BBQCamp.de for the base-function and the idea)

#### Features
Language: This Plug-In is localized in German currently.
I will add multilanguage support when I find time and also a detection-method to know what language a certain user has set in his TSÂ³ settings.
