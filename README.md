## VeganMassMove
This Plug-In allows a user to move users of a channel to the target channel.


#### Features
- German Language (may be extended in the future)
- No "Move whole server" Button (which can lead to a lot of trouble sometimes)
- Move Users from selected channel to your own channel ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SINE/VeganMassMove/master/plugins/lua_plugin/VeganMassMove/move_here_by_SINE.png "Move Here Icon")
- Move Users from your channel to the selected channel ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SINE/VeganMassMove/master/plugins/lua_plugin/VeganMassMove/move_there_by_SINE.png "Move There Icon")
- New Icons (as you see above)
- Channel Password compatibility (thanks to Dave from BBQCamp.de for the base-function and the idea)

#### Language and Localization
This Plug-In is localized in German currently.
I will add multilanguage support when I find time and also a detection-method to know what language a certain user has set in his TSÂ³ settings.
